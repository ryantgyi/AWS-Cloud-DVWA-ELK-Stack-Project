This will be a comprhensive guide to create your AWS network, install docker and ansible, and deploy DVWA, ELK stack, filebeat, and metric beat to your various VM's inside your network. We will be using AWS CloudFormation to deploy our network infrastructure quickly. Once our network has been deployed, we can choose to edit it further if more is required from our network.
